# OSS Charter

Open source software is essential for modern statistical production, fostering transparency in methodology and promoting international collaboration in developing and supporting the production of official statistics.

Consequently, the charter and principles herein on Open Source Software in official statistics in both the production of software, and the adoption of software for statistical production, have been drafted under the HLG-MOS Open-Source Software Project for consideration of endorsement by the UNECE HLG-MOS.

Be aware that content found here is currently under draft and should not be considered final copy at the current time of writing.
